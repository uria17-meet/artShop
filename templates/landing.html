			<h2 style="color: white">The Concept</h2>
			<p>In this website, every artist that wants to sell his arworks, can easly sign up and post his art. <br>
			Then, peaple that like art and saw an artwork that they liked can contact the artist and buy it. <br> 
			<p>This gives an opertunity and a start point for young or unknown artists.</p>
